                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    I'm a junior software developer focused on learning and building modern web applications, with a growing interest in full-stack development.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    I enjoy learning through hands-on projects and courses, mainly working with React while exploring Python and related frameworks.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed">Outside of coding, I enjoy cars, driving, and ricing my Arch + Hyprland environment.</p>
